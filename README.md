# Machine Learning: Fantasy Football Projections

Fantasy football has become extremely popular over the last 10 years. The [Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association](https://thefsga.org/industry-demographics/) estimated that there were 36 million fantasy football participants in the United States in 2019. Of those participants, roughly 80% spent money in some way to play. According to [FOX Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/fantasy-football-the-billion-industry), in 2018 the average player spent $556 in league-related costs.

This means that players are trying to find any advantage that they can to get a leg up on their competition.

There are many different sources out there that provide in-depth fantasy football analysis to players. Some are available publicly and others require a paid subscription. With the surge in popularity, this has become a business in itself.

I’ve always been fascinated with the projections that these sources put out there. Finally, after a few years of wondering whose projections are reliable, what goes into these numbers, and if it’s really worth spending my money on, I decided to begin building my own algorithm for fantasy football projections.

By the end of this, I will show you the basic building blocks to building a fantasy football projection algorithm of your own.
